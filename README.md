# to-markdown

An HTML to Markdown converter written in javascript.

A basic implementation is there, but it's not yet fully bulletproof (contributions welcome!).

## Known issues

There are a couple of known issues surrounding blockquotes in lists (and perhaps vice versa) &mdash; #2; and also how to handle HTML elements outside of the markdown subset (keep them/strip them?) &mdash; #3.
